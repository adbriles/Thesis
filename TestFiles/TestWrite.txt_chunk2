Constantine Seferlis<====>4265154<====>Constantine SeferlisConstantine L.  Seferlis (1930–2005) is acknowledged as a master sculptor and stone carver whose works exemplified a group of public monumental artists in the United States during the second half of the 20th century.   Many of these stone masters were immigrants, primarily from southern Europe, including Italy and Greece, and they trained and worked in the classical milieu.  Seferlis himself was born near Sparta, Greece, and, because of his precocious talent, was enrolled at an early age in the National Academy of Fine Arts in Athens.   It was at the National Academy that Seferlis developed his artistic voice, his naturalistic style, and his love for the medium of stone.

Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D<====>4265183<====>Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D  The Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D is a small turbofan engine built by Pratt & Whitney Canada.  It was introduced in 1971 at   thrust, and has since undergone a series of upgrades to just over   thrust in the latest versions.  It is the primary powerplant for a wide variety of smaller jet aircraft, notably business jets. Design and developmentThe JT15D is rare among modern turbofans in that it uses a centrifugal compressor as its main high-pressure system.   This was a common feature of early jet engines, but was quickly replaced by axial compressors in most roles due to its large frontal size.

Perinatal mortality<====>4265185<====>Perinatal mortality  Perinatal mortality (PNM), also perinatal death, refers to the death of a fetus or neonate and is the basis to calculate the perinatal mortality rate.   Variations in the precise definition of the perinatal mortality exist specifically concerning the issue of inclusion or exclusion of early fetal and late neonatal fatalities.  The World Health Organization defines perinatal mortality as the "number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life per 1,000 total births, the perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation and ends seven completed days after birth",  but other definitions have been used.

Kutta condition<====>4265190<====>Kutta conditionThe Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils.   It is named for German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Wilhelm Kutta. Kuethe and Schetzer state the Kutta condition as follows:  A body with a sharp trailing edge which is moving through a fluid will create about itself a circulation of sufficient strength to hold the rear stagnation point at the trailing edge. In fluid flow around a body with a sharp corner, the Kutta condition refers to the flow pattern in which fluid approaches the corner from both directions, meets at the corner, and then flows away from the body.
