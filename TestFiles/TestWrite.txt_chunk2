Kutta condition<====>4265190<====>Kutta conditionThe Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils.

In fluid flow around a body with a sharp corner, the Kutta condition refers to the flow pattern in which fluid approaches the corner from both directions, meets at the corner, and then flows away from the body.

Ketel<====>4265421<====>Ketel Ketel is a legendary Magyar tribal chieftain of perhaps Kabar origin, who lived at the end of the 9th century. He was the father of Alaptolma,  and the first known ancestor of the Koppán clan.According to the medieval Gesta Hungarorum, the leader of the Magyars, Árpád, donated a large estate to Ketel along the Danube and Váh (Vág) rivers where he settled with his people. Today, Ketel is honoured as the legendary founder of the city of Komárom/Komárno with his son, Alaptolma.References

Lebedev quadrature<====>4265440<====>Lebedev quadratureIn numerical analysis, Lebedev quadrature, named after Vyacheslav Ivanovich Lebedev, is an approximation to the surface integral of a function over a three-dimensional sphere.  The grid is constructed so to have octahedral rotation and inversion symmetry.  The number and location of the grid points together with a corresponding set of integration weights are determined by enforcing the exact integration of polynomials (or equivalently, spherical harmonics) up to a given order, leading to a sequence of increasingly dense grids analogous to the one-dimensional  Gauss-Legendre scheme. The Lebedev grid is often employed in the numerical evaluation of volume integrals in the spherical coordinate system, where it is combined with a one-dimensional integration scheme for the radial coordinate.
